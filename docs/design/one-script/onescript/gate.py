"""4 gate — the doors. Every change passes here; every gate fails closed and loud.

Cites: CONST-III (default-deny; standing grants), CONST-II, §0.2, §0.3, CONST-V.2,
App. B (the probes boot runs against this module).

A change is PR-shaped: it says what it Cites, what it Amends, or None, because...
"The law" is the fixed half (the constitution's Trace IDs) plus the user's half
(grants, precedents, sealed rows). Python checks that a citation exists, is
known, and matches what the change touches. Whether it is *true* is a witness's
job, and only the human's seal makes it so.
