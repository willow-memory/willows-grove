"""tests/test_scans_fire.py — the meta-scan: every AST/grep-guard helper this
suite carries has been shown to catch something, by a test that *calls it*.

G2-meta-scans-grove (fleet loop plan, Wave 2). *A scan that has never fired
has not been shown to check anything.* This suite is full of scans — pins
that read a workflow, a component, a doc, or a module's source and ask it a
question (``tests/test_port_map.py`` greps four files for a port number,
``tests/test_state_vocabulary_audit.py`` greps every component for its state
words, ``tests/test_docs_links_resolve.py`` walks every relative link) — and
several already carry the house self-check "the pattern still matches
*something*" so a regex that silently stops matching cannot turn the file
into a green no-op. That self-check proves the scan sees the tree. It does
not prove the scan would *object* to anything: a helper whose judgment is
subtly wrong still finds plenty and still passes. Only a planted violation
proves that. This file is that rule turned into a test that reads the
*other* test files: it finds every module-level helper in ``tests/`` that is
shaped like a violation-scanner and asserts that some planted-violation test
in the *same file* runs that helper — directly, or through another helper it
calls.

**Not a fresh design.** This is homestead-ledger's ``tests/test_scans_fire.py``
(itself the sibling drift sweeps' meta-scan, copied for its shape from
homestead-health and the engine), ported here and re-grounded against this
repo's own test files. The discovery rule and the plant rule below are
theirs, verified here rather than re-derived, because a meta-scan that
disagreed between repos about what counts as "planted" would be exactly the
kind of drift the fleet's sweep exists to close. One re-grounding, planted
below rather than assumed: this suite writes most of its tests as methods of
``unittest.TestCase`` classes, so a plant test is looked for in class bodies
as well as at module level — the same reading the inline half already gave
``tree.body`` in the original, applied to both halves.

**The native ancestor.** ``tests/test_panel_wiring_coverage.py`` is this
repo's own test-about-tests: it imports ``tests/test_panel_wiring.py`` and
asserts a ``*WiringTests`` class with the three-state methods exists for
every row of INVARIANTS.md §4's table. That is a *coverage* meta-pin — does
a test exist for each promise. This file is the *efficacy* meta-pin beside
it — has each scan been shown to fire. The two ask different questions of
the same layer and neither subsumes the other: a wiring class can exist and
assert nothing, and a scan can fire on a plant and still cover one row of
six. The ancestor reads the module through ``importlib``/``inspect``; this
one reads source through ``ast``, because the thing it needs to see (what a
helper's body *does*) is not on the imported object.

**Discovery is structural, not a naming convention.** A rule that only
matched a leading underscore or a stem list would miss a public
``check_payload_reach(...)`` (an AST-walking scan spelled the way a helper
meant to be imported is spelled) and a grep-shaped ``forbidden_word_hits(path)``
that reads a file and asks ``"payload" in text`` with no ``ast`` and no
matching stem at all — both are planted below, alongside the real thing. So
the rule is what a scan *does*:

* it parses or walks source (``ast.parse``, ``ast.walk``), **or**
* it matches text with a pattern (``re.search``/``findall``/``finditer``/
  ``match``/``fullmatch``/``compile``, or a module-level compiled pattern's
  ``.search(…)``), **or**
* it reads a file's text (``.read_text()``/``.read_bytes()``, ``open(…).read()``,
  ``inspect.getsource``) *and* asks a membership question (``x in text``), **or**
* it walks a module-level word list asking membership of each entry, or
  filters a list its caller handed it the same way.

The name stems and the ``_is_`` prefix are kept on top of that, not instead
of it: they still catch helpers that hand their work to a caller. Discovery
is a union, so it is strictly wider than either half alone.

**Having a plant means a plant test calls the scan.** A test called
``test_the_guard_fires`` that never touches the guard has not fired it — the
word in a test's name is not the evidence. A helper counts as planted only
when a ``test_*`` function or method whose name carries ``plant``, ``fires``
or ``catches`` (or whose docstring carries ``plant``) reaches it — through
the module's own helpers as well as directly, so a plant that calls a
wrapper has exercised the parser underneath it too. Both halves are planted
below: the name-only plant test (a counter-example that must still be
reported) and the call-through-a-helper case (which must not).

**Honest about what it still cannot see.** A helper that reaches
``ast.parse`` through an alias (``from ast import parse as p``), one that
shells out to ``grep``, or one whose whole check is a comparison of two
already-read strings with no membership test and no pattern, is outside the
rule above. Closing those needs an interpreter, not a reader; this scan is
the AST-grep half, not a promise that it sees everything a scan could be
shaped like. The sweep is ``tests/test_*.py`` — the leg CI runs as the main
suite. ``tests/e2e_ollama/`` and ``tests/e2e_willow_mcp/`` are their own CI
legs with their own harnesses and are not swept here.

# ── the inline half: a scan written directly in a test's own body ───────────
#
# Everything above reads *module-level helpers*. A guard written inline, in
# a test's own body, with nothing to name and nothing to plant, is invisible
# to it — `tests/test_u2u_invariants_cited.py`'s anchor check,
# `tests/test_docs_no_dead_envvar_references.py`'s dead-knob sweep and
# `tests/test_mcp_local_oauth_hardening.py`'s dead-code grep were exactly
# this shape before this bite factored them out. This half closes that gap:
# it walks every `test_*` function's own body for the same shapes the
# module-helper half already knows, holds it to the same "reads a file, not
# a string it built" requirement, and clears a test that delegates to a scan
# helper already defined (and already required to be planted) somewhere in
# `tests/` — recognized by name, whichever module actually owns it, since
# `from tests.test_x import _helper` and a bare call to a same-file helper
# are the same delegation by a different route.
#
# "Reads a membership question of it" is held to the text actually read, not
# to anything built from it: a name bound directly to a `.read_text()`/
# `.read_bytes()` call (one level, no chain through `json.loads` or the
# like) counts; a dict key or a `Path.parents` check several steps removed
# does not. Loosening that would also catch `"x" in pyproject["project"]` and
# similar ordinary assertions that have nothing to do with scanning a tree,
# and a rule that cries wolf on those gets an allowlist bolted onto it and
# stops meaning anything, exactly the fate the module docstring above warns
# the word-list shape away from.


#: String operations that narrow text without turning it into something
#: else: `source.split("def _route_post")[1]` is still the file's own text,
#: and a membership question of it is still a question of the tree. The list
#: is deliberately all `str`/`bytes` methods — `json.loads(...)` is a bare
#: call to a *name*, not one of these, so a dict built from a read is still
#: several steps removed and still not a scan.
